 # Universal Translator

 In this playground, we will build a universal speech-to-speech translator.
 
 ![Star Trek Universal Translator](UniversalTranslator.jpg)
 
 Our universal translator will convert speech from one language to another. For example, we could convert English speech to French speech.
 
 Our universal translator will combine three Watson services for speech-to-speech translation:
 1. Speech to Text: Convert English audio to English text.
 2. Language Translator: Translate English text to French text.
 3. Text to Speech: Convert French text to French audio.
 
 ![Service Flowchart](Flowchart.png)
 
 We'll start by exploring each of the three services independently. Then we'll combine them to build our universal speech-to-speech translator.

 ## Speech to Text: Convert English Audio to English Text
 
 The first step is to turn English audio to English text using the Speech to Text service.
