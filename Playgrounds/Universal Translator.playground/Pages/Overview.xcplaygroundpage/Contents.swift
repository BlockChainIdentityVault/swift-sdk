 # Universal Translator

 In this playground, we will build a universal speech-to-speech translator.

 Our universal translator will convert speech from one language to another. For example, we could convert English speech to French speech.
 
 Our universal translator will combine three Watson services for speech-to-speech translation:
 1. Speech to Text: Convert English audio to English text.
 2. Language Translator: Translate English text to French text.
 3. Text to Speech: Convert French text to French audio.
 
 ![Service Flowchart](Flowchart.png)
 
 We'll start by exploring each of the three services independently. Then we'll combine them to build our universal speech-to-speech translator.
