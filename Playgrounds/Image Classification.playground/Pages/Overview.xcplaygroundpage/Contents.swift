 - Note: The IBM Watson Visual Recognition service uses deep learning algorithms to analyze images for scenes, objects, faces, and other content. The response includes keywords that provide information about the content. A set of built-in classes provides highly accurate results without training. You can train custom classifiers to create specialized classes. You can also create custom collections of your own images, and then upload an image to search the collection for similar images.
 
 - Note: The following image shows the process of creating and using a custom classifier.
